# Lyric Finder

This is a small app that allows users to find song's lyrics using **MusixMatch** developers API. It also fetches the songs album cover from other external API to give users a image preview and help them identify the corresponding artists.

## Techs under the hood 
This app is made using <strong>React js</strong>, webpack for modules fetch and the <strong>context API</strong> to handle a share state between components such as the *search bar* and the *tracklist* to update the desire information.
Special thanks to *Traversy Media* for his great tutorial of React context API. 

## What I practice 
- React's own context API
- React's lifecycle functions
- Axios async requests
- Webpack module distribution
- Reactstrap
