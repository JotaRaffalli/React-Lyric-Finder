## Techs under the hood 
This app is made using <strong>React js</strong>, webpack for modules fetch and <strong>context API</strong> to handle a share state of information passed by components such as the *search*.
<i> Special thanks to Traversy Media for his great tutorial of React context API </i>

## What I practice 
- React's own context API
- React's lifecycle functions
- Axios async requests
- Webpack module distribution
- Reactstrap
